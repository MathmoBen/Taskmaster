# Taskmaster

This is an attempt to analyse the wording of the tasks from the TV show Taskmster, as scraped from the fan wiki

(Note a small caveat: phrases like "Your time starts..." or "Your time started when..." are omited from the above.) The below is the first attempt at a wordcloud of the tasks from series 17.
